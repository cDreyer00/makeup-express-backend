For a business meeting, the goal is to curate a professional look that is both polished and confident. With your specific features in mind, here are some tailored makeup and fashion tips:

Makeup:
- Base: A natural and even base is essential. Use a light to medium coverage foundation to even out your skin tone while allowing your natural complexion to shine through. A touch of concealer can be applied to areas that may need a bit more coverage.
- Eyes: Keep your eye makeup simple and sophisticated. Neutral eyeshadow tones, such as soft browns or beiges, work well. A thin line of eyeliner on your upper lid, as seen in your photo, maintains definition without being too dramatic. Mascara can be used to enhance your lashes subtly.
- Brows: Gently fill in any sparse areas of your brows to create a natural and well-groomed appearance.
- Lips: Opt for a nude or soft pink lip color that complements your skin tone for a polished finish.
- Face: A light dusting of blush on the cheeks can give a healthy-looking flush, and a touch of highlighter on the cheekbones will bring a gentle radiance to the face.

Fashion:
- Top: A tailored blouse in a neutral color such as white, light blue, or soft pink would be a good choice. It keeps the look business-appropriate while still being stylish. Ensure it's well-fitted and free from wrinkles.
- Bottoms: A pair of high-waisted trousers or a pencil skirt in a classic color like black, navy, or charcoal gray would pair nicely with the blouse.
- Outerwear: Consider a fitted blazer that matches your trousers or skirt to complete the ensemble. This will add an extra layer of polish to your outfit.
- Footwear: Closed-toe heels or elegant flats are suitable for a business meeting. Choose a color that complements your overall look without being too flashy.
- Accessories: Minimal jewelry, such as stud earrings or a delicate necklace, is appropriate. A professional tote bag or a structured handbag will serve both functional and fashionable purposes.
Remember to consider the culture and dress code of your workplace when tailoring these suggestions to ensure they align with business standards. Good luck with your meeting!

For a rock party, you could consider intensifying your look to match the bold and energetic atmosphere of the event. Drawing on your current look in the photo and stepping it up a notch, here are personalized recommendations:

Makeup:
- Eyes: Your winged eyeliner is already a classic rock-inspired choice. You might want to extend it for a more dramatic cat-eye or consider using a thicker line. Adding a touch of glitter or metallic eyeshadow on your lid or along the lower lash line could give you some added sparkle under the party lights.
- Brows: Your brows have a nice shape that frames your face. For the event, you could add a bit more definition with brow pomade or powder, ensuring they stand out even in dim lighting.
- Lips: A bold color like a vibrant red, dark berry, or even a daring black could really set your look apart. Choose a matte finish for staying power while you're at the party.
- Skin: Since you have a lovely complexion, you can keep it fresh with a light foundation or a BB cream. A bit of bronzer along your cheekbones and temples can enhance the contours of your face, and a dab of highlighter on your cheekbones and the bridge of your nose will add to the rockstar glow.

Fashion:
- Top: Consider picking a top with stud details or graphic prints of rock icons or bands to maintain the thematic vibe. A leather jacket over a band tee is an iconic ensemble that never goes out of style.
- Bottoms: Black skinny jeans or leather pants are staples for a rock concert look. If you want something more daring, try distressed denim with fishnet insets or a studded mini skirt.
- Footwear: Sturdy boots like Doc Martens or combat boots are both fashion-forward and practical for dancing or standing at a concert. If you're wanting some extra height, heeled booties can also work well.
- Accessories: Play up the rock aesthetic with accessories like a spiked choker, leather wrist cuffs, or layered necklaces with symbolically rock 'n' roll pendants like skulls or guitars.

Remember, a rock party is the perfect occasion to express yourself and showcase your unique style. Have fun making a statement and enjoy the music!

For a rock party, you can go for a look that's edgy and bold to match the high-energy vibe of the event. Based on the photo you've provided, here are some personalized makeup and fashion suggestions:

Makeup:
- Eyes: A smoky eye look would be perfect for a rock party. You can use black or dark grey eyeshadow to create this effect and add some silver shimmer to the inner corners for a pop of brightness. Bold, winged eyeliner will complement the smoky eyeshadow and give your eyes a dramatic effect.
- Brows: Keep your eyebrows well-defined and filled in to frame your face.
- Lips: A bold red or deep burgundy lip color can add intensity to your look and is a classic choice for rock-inspired makeup.
- Face: You might want to add a bit more contour to define your cheekbones and a touch of highlighter on the high points of your face for a subtle glow.

Fashion:
- Top: A leather or faux leather jacket paired with a band t-shirt is a timeless choice. You can also opt for a black lace or mesh top for a mix of edgy and feminine.
- Bottoms: Skinny jeans or black leather pants will work well. If you prefer skirts, a black mini skirt with fishnet tights can also be very rock-n-roll.
- Footwear: Combat boots or heeled ankle boots will tie your outfit together and are practical for dancing.
- Accessories: Studded belts, chunky bracelets, and choker necklaces are great accessories to amplify your rock party look.

Remember, the key is to balance comfort with style so you can enjoy the party while feeling confident in your outfit and makeup. Enjoy your rock party!
